# Genetic-building-of-teeth-and-odontodes

**Review** of gene expression patterns during tooth and odontode development in vertebrates, with a focus on the small-spotted catshark _Scyliorhinus canicula_. 

**Related publication:** 

The role of this database is to have an overview of gene expressions characterizing the development of odontodes and tooth-like structures in vertebrates. We reference gene expressions from _in situ_ hybidizations compared to those tested in _S. canicula_.
